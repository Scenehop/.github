## Our Goal 
### “Do to others as you would have them do to you”

We are ***Scenehop**, a volunteer-based video sharing platform* with **you**, the people, in mind. 
Our platform was founded on one common goal: *pointing out the wrongdoing in today’s corporate greed-filled society, and correcting it with our own independent platform.*
We aren’t backed by millions of dollars. We don’t have a big corporation, or the government, or a billionaire backing us. But what we do have is something that has more power than all of those combined. We have the ***people***. We aim to provide a common platform to unite and revolt against modern corporations and platforms, such as YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok. They prioritize profits, whilst we prioritize consumers; *because at the end of the day, we are all **consumers**.*

### Progress

As of today (December 6th 2025), our **Development Team** has made significant progress, *successfully laying the essential architectural groundwork* for our project.
This work represents a successful transition from the basic planning to foundational implementation.
Furthermore, our newly founded **Marketing & Design Group** has begun its work on the advertising plan and the About Us page for Scenehop.


### Roadmap

Our immediate focus is to create a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
The core goal is to launch a minimal product that is fully functional. This includes:

	- the Core Feature Set, i.e. User accounts and profiles, video uploading and playing, browsing, public comments, likes, and subscriptions.
	- a Creator Dashboard that provides basic analytics, such as views and watch time.
	- the Implementation of core components, including the API, the integration of object storage and a CDN for video delivery, etc.
	- and essential moderation tools such as content reporting, an admin review queue, and a takedown endpoint.


The public launch will consist of three stages, as to ensure operational stability:

	1. Private Alpha: Testing with a small group to validate core functionality.
	2. Invite-Only Beta: Expansion to a few hundred creators and viewers to tune scaling and policy effectiveness.
	3. Public Launch: Open registration and broad onboarding campaigns upon achieving readiness signals (uptime, performance, moderation throughput).


Post-launch, the focus will shift to making Scenehop a sustainable and compelling platform, especially focusing on making it easy and attractive for creators to move to our site,
as well as integrating new users into our Community by building network effects and supporting integrations like embedding, RSS feeds, and more.
A big focus is continuing to build platform safety and legal defensibility through clear community guidelines, an abuse triage dashboard, and a documented DMCA takedown receiving process.
Lastly, we will also work on optimizing, such as implementing systems to handle high traffic, and hardening security to ensure high availability and cost-efficiency.
